## {{icon:heartbeat}} Tell me more...

Project maid is a game development project I've been bouncing around in my head, on paper, and in code, for over *five years* now. However, along the way I've been distracted, hit coding walls, and generally lost track of where I got to. It's about time I get writing about this project and make the development process more widely available.
