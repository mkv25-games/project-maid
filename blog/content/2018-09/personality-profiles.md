# Personality profiles

**Proposed 8th September 2018, Updated: 9th September 2018**

To get things started, lets talk about personality profiles. Here in lie some fundamental ideas about how I want to drive gameplay and decision making. The following prose is written as statement to help clarify my thoughts.

## Context

Given that little to know written thought has gone into the design so far; these ideas fall to be explored further before they can be made concrete. The exploration of these ideas should lead to further analysis and actionable game development tasks.

## Big five traits

After selecting personality traits on five dimensions, Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism; a character can then be given desires and wants that further drive their behaviour.

Assuming for simulation purposes that basic needs are met; there should be some common goals - such as financial, career, responsibility, creativity, sociality. When talking to a character they will bring up their desires if unfulfilled. To create some variety, a conscious and unconscious desire will help drive the discussion an unconscious desire that's met won't be mentioned until it is strong enough to surface. Desires should line up with abilities and functions within the game; for example a desire for nature might lead to the gardening skill, or perhaps farming, living in a forest, or working outdoors. These overlaps are important to ensure  players can help develop characters with multiple solutions in mind. The game here is to understand a character's desires through conversation, and then take actions to support or encourage further development. Such actions might involve moving a staff member between locations, giving them a gift, assigning them to new job, giving them more or less responsibility, or sending them on training. All these elements will affect productivity and satisfaction; with characters performing their best when operating at an optimal level of satisfaction.

Hobbies will also play an important part in a character's engagement model. Knowing what a character is trying to achieve outside of their job will give hints to other drivers. Such conversations might open up insights into underlying drivers or ulterior motives.

This model should work for all types of characters, including player loyal maids, friends, enemies, neutral parties, and government departments. If modelled correctly, a standard conversation interface could be used for creating engaging dialog with meaningful outcomes.

## Analysis

This section is for reading back over the meat of the ideas, and perhaps adding more insight.

## Outcomes

Any and all actions to be written here.
