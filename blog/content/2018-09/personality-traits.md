# Personality traits

Proposed: **9th September 2018**, Updated: **9th September 2018**

Using the big five personality categories of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism; I derived words based on a gradient between more like their traity and less like their trait.

In doing so, a detailed picture of a character can be generated procedurally using just five variables.

For example: An inventive, efficient, outgoing, friendly, but sensitive individual can be contrasted with a cautious, careless, reserved, unkind, yet confident character.

In my original analysis, I simplified these properties down to two values; efficiency and warmth. Efficiency was meant to value individual work ethic as a positive towards speed of task completion. Warmth was meant to value team cohesion and create a simplified personality scale for use when creating dialogue. However in retrospect, I think the five types should be distinct, and the dialogue based on the context of one the big five traits given a particular situation.

## Openness

Openness describes an individual's fluidity in considering, disseminating, and accepting new ideas. Open individuals tend to be more social, but in this context I wanted to treat them as either inventive or curious. Negative open traits by my simplification include consistent and cautious.

- Inventive - able to generate and discuss new ideas, driving forward the conversation
- Curious - on the lookout for new information, ideas, and perspectives
- Consistent - works within the status quo, listens carefully to instructions
- Cautious - often over thinks the situation, constantly questioning their decisions

## Conscientiousness

Conscientiousness describes an individual's ability to complete tasks in a diligent and accurate fashion; such individuals are thoughtful and aware of their surroundings. Unconscientious people are characterized by their easy-going nature, or outright carelessness.

-	Efficient - dutiful, accurate, and precise; little time is wasted when working
-	Organized - tidy and timely, able to work thoroughly on a task
-	Easy-going - relaxed and carefree, works at their own pace
-	Careless - downright negligent; a klutz and not in a good way; unable to perform anything but the simplest task without error

## Extraversion

Extraversion describes an individual's outwardly facing demeanor. Different from openness, extraverts tend to be more outgoing and energetic, whereas introverts tend to be solitary and reserved.

- Outgoing - always ready to lead the way, doesn't like being stuck inside or in the same place for too long
- Energetic - full of energy, ready and willing to start on any task
- Reserved - keeps to themselves, unlikely to take part in activities
- Solitary - prefers to work alone, focusing on one task at a time

## Agreeableness

Agreeableness describes an individual's acceptance of others and their feelings towards others. Disagreeable people tend to be described as cold or unkind.

- Friendly - bright and chatty, eager to please
-	Compassionate - understanding, a good listener
-	Cold - short tempered, quick to criticise
-	Unkind - deliberately mean; disregards other people's feelings

## Neuroticism

Neuroticism describes an individual's sensitivity and confidence in any given situation. Neurotic people tend to be overly cautious and nervous; likely to lash out, panic, or worry unnecessarily. Less neurotic people tend to describe themselves as secure, confident, or relaxed in most situations.

- Sensitive - highly reactive to new environments, takes a while to adjust to new situations
-	Nervous - constantly unsure, on edge; looking for a way out back to safety
-	Secure - comfortable within their own skin, happy to take on most tasks
-	Confident - conscious of their own abilities, and respondent to new challenges

## Task focused work for all

Given the descriptions above, we can see a bias towards task focused behaviours; behaviours which in the context of working might make certain individuals predisposed to certain kinds of work. I think it is important to find work for all types of characters; that is to say while we can create imperfect descriptions of individuals, it should be possible to find appropriate tasks for everyone given the right training, encouragement, and support. Where we base these personalities in reality, we should be supportive of different attitudes towards different professions.

In support of this goal, there should be a range of tasks and projects that characters can be assigned to which will result in more or less valuable outcomes, and generate better or worse job satisfaction for the individual. This in turn can drive personal goals for individual based on their needs.

## Where next?

In future articles we'll be exploring the needs of characters by discussing their public and hidden hierarchies based on individual drivers; all of which will be based on the personality traits described here.
