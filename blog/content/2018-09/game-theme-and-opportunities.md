# {{icon:atlas}} Game Theme and Opportunities

{{icon:user-circle}} Proposed: **2nd September 2018**; {{icon:pencil-alt}} Updated: **10th September 2018**

# Opportunities

To craft a narrative; we identified opportunities as core gameplay mechanics for players to explore. To enable these opportunities we need to create a world for events to play out in. Stories formed by posing situations; giving the player a choice that will enact some change, and then showing the result of those changes through dialogue with characters.

## What time period / setting is this?
- Alternate modern reality; near future 2010

We didn't want to be constrained by real world political or terrain; so a world that mirrors reality, with access to advanced technology, but where workers feel a sense of responsibility and loyalty, such that a player could build up their own empire; or influence other empires in the area.

## What world does your character live in?
- Alternate simplified European world; use cultural themes set against modern tropes

Using tropes from Europe allows us to tap into styles and culture that feel familiar without directly misrepresenting specific nations or backgrounds. The character can orient themselves towards more familiar tropes; such as English, French, or German without specifically calling out these nations in the game.

## Who is the player?

We considered a few alternatives, used early in the 2013 development cycle:
- A Young inheritor
- An inventor
- A retiring millionaire
- A fallen magnate

But for the 2018 reboot we decided on one background story for the player character:
- An inheritor; with money to burn, a house to look after - and abundance of maids available to hire
- Lots of tasks going on in house - for which you'll need to hire in support

Based on those criteria; the choice to hire maids becomes a necessity rather then an option. This little bit of rail roading sets the scene for the rest of the game; the player should be ready to engage with the game and suspend belief for a while.

## What opportunities are there for the player in the world?

These opportunities can be considered as endpoints for the game; end goals that the player must work towards by carefully constructing their empire by making the right hires and training and selecting their staff to the right level.

- Back a princess; helping them seize the throne
- Topple a government and claim the land for your own
- Start a business empire
- Negotiate peace between warring nations
- Become a shady assassination organisation
- Become a military commander operating tanks
- Become a celebrity cooking superstar
- Become a beer merchant selling brews internationally
- Launch a space rocket
- Become a tech extraordinaire revolutionising the world
- Replace all your staff with robot maids
- Cause a robot revolution that takes over humanity

We'll explore these end goals in more detail to help drive out the gameplay mechanics required to make these scenarios possible.

## Types of opportunities
- Long term game goals
- Short term interest goals

Short term interests might help the player learn mechanics within the game; or provide a short boost to cash flow, hiring opportunities, or training. These short term goals will help the player progress in material terms, even if they bring the player no further or close to a long term goal.

Long term goals, as highlighted by end game opportunities, will help the player strive towards the next step in the game. On the way to becoming a celebrity cooking superstar, for example, the player might need to make their first appearance on a TV show, followed by developing a new recipe with their cooking staff, and then writing and publishing a cook book.

## Maid academies
- Maid academy next door, next town over
- HELP WANTED?
- Chief maid of the academy gets in touch

In order to hire maids someone needs to be training them; so introduced is the Chief Maid of a local maid academy. Such an academy has been training maids for a few years now and is looking to provide suitable employment for her staff. Being such close neighbours the Maid Chief is offering you first refusal on appropriate staff. In return, you can request specific skills to assist with finding the right hire. The hiring mechanic is core to starting the game, and will be returned to on a regular basis to expand your estates.

## And why do they suddenly need to start employing maids?
- They have spare money
- Because they have delusions of grandeur
- Because they want to take over the world
- Because they want to get to know a bunch of interesting maids, who they also employ.

So lets cover this topic off again; why are we hiring maids again? Hopefully its obvious! You've inherited money with which to burn; you have delusions of grandeur; you want to take over the world, and of course you want to get to know a bunch of interesting maids, who you employ, who are dedicated and loyal to your cause.

Project maid! Hire all the maids. Start an empire. Fulfil your dreams.
